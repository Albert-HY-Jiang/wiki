# CS128

[CS128 (Introduction to Computer Science II)](../Course%20Wiki/CS%20Course%20Offerings/CS128.md) is the second programming course in the Computer Science core curriculum, and covers fundamentals of object-oriented C++ programming.

## Required Knowledge

A list of topics tested is available on the [CS128 Proficiency Website](https://proficiency.cs128.org). In recent semesters, CS128 has stopped covering several topics on this list, which students can probably ignore when preparing for the exam:

- `cpp-httplib` library
- `nlohmann::json` library
- SQLite ORM
- Configuring an HTTP server that processes JSON

## Exam Format

The exam consists of a number of short-answer questions followed by 2-3 programming questions, which are at the level of MPs in the course.

## How to Prepare

Programming questions comprise the majority of your score, so you should focus on practicing C++ programming:

- Implement common data structures (singly linked list, doubly linked list, binary search tree, vector) using raw pointers and smart pointers. Make sure these implementations use templatized containers that follow C++ best practices.
- Practice implementing algorithms using the C++ standard template library (STL) and lambda functions, making sure you understand the lambdas you write.
- Use the Catch2 library to test all the code you write.

Short-answer questions are programming-related, so the knowledge you gain from practicing programming should be enough to prepare you for short-answer questions.

## Advice

The CS128 proficiency exam is generally considered to be the hardest CS proficiency exam, but you should still try it, since there's no penalty for not passing. If you don't pass, don't worry: if you have C++ knowledge, CS128 will be very easy. Many strong programmers have tried and failed to pass this exam.
