# Welcome

Welcome to the [HKN](https://hkn.illinois.edu) Wiki! This wiki is independently maintained by students, for students, as a guide to ECE courses at Illinois. This wiki is still under construction as we migrate off Illinois Wiki and update our content, so please bear with us as we fix any missing content.

You can contribute to this wiki too! Any updates, from fixing a typo to adding a page for your favorite elective, are welcome. Please follow the contributing section below.

## Using the wiki

For information on core and elective ECE courses, as well as related courses from other departments, head to the [Course Wiki](/Course%20Wiki) tab. We've compiled several example schedules (i.e. how to graduate quickly) in the [Example Schedules](/Example%20Schedules) tab. The [Curriculum Graph](/Curriculum%20Graph) houses an overall picture of what courses you need to complete as an ECE major, and [More Advice](/More%20Advice) and [Proficiency Exams](/Proficiency%20Exams) contain other useful information, like how to skip some courses, or prepare for grad school.

## Who made this?

Dr. Everitt's Neighborhood (DEN) is managed by [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.illinois.edu), an Electrical and Computer Engineering RSO. We accept contributions from any Illinois students, but review any new content for quality and accuracy before updating the wiki.

## Contributing to the wiki
