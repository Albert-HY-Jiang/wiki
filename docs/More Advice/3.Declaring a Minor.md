# Declaring a Minor

## What is a Minor?
A minor is a secondary area of education beyond your specified major. Minors are not an additional degree that you recieve with your major at graduation, but rather an additional qualification that is added to your degree upon graduation. Declaring a minor is not required for graduation, however, students who have a particular interest in a field or feel that a minor would be beneficial to their degree typically declare a minor. 

## Should I Declare an Undergraduate Minor? 
Taking on an additional program of study like a minor can be a lot of extra work, minors range from 15 to 21 (maximum) credit hours of additional work on top of your major. Students who pursue a minor are typically a semester ahead in their major curriculum
