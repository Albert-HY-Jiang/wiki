# EE Curriculum

Curriculum graphs are still under active development, and work best on desktop browsers. If the complete graph isn't visible, click and drag to pan, or scroll to zoom. A dashed arrow from one course to another indicates that, while the first course is a prerequisite to the second, the two courses may be taken concurrently.
