# Overview

If you want to take a certain pair of courses in the same semester in order to graduate early or reach some high-level course early, but are unsure if such an action will severely damage your mental health, GPA, and/or social life (in no particular order), then this section of the course wiki is for you. This section is dedicated to advising/warning students about the perils of taking certain combinations of courses (and whether such a combination would be a right fit for you). The following list contains all pairs that currently have an active wiki page. It's terribly short, so please consider contributing by going to our [GitHub](https://github.com/hkn-alpha/wiki) and opening a pull request by following the readme.
