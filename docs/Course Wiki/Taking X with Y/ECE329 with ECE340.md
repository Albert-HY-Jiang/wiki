## Who should take them?
EE majors are required to take both courses. [ECE340](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) has [ECE329](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE329.md) as a co/pre-requisite, but their overall content does not overlap very much. Anyone who wants to take [ECE340](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) ASAP should take these two courses when they get junior eligibility.

## Workload:
Both courses just have weekly homeworks with [ECE329](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE329.md) having 3 midterms and [ECE340](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) with 2 midterms.

Attending lectures and good time management to start homeworks early should be plenty to be successful in both courses. The content does not overlap that much, so struggling in a topic in one class will not doom you for the other class.

Taking these two courses together is the fastest way to take [ECE340](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE340.md) and get to upper level semiconductor courses like [ECE441](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE441.md) and [ECE444](../ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE444.md), or just getting it over with.
