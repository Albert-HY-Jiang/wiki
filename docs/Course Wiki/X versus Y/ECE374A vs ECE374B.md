There are two versions of 374 offered at UIUC, section A and section B. Both sections cover roughly the same content, with some exceptions. Both fulfill the same requirements and work as prerequisites for the same classes. They do however have different lectures, different discussions, different homeworks and exams, and different grading. Most people consider the B section to be less difficult than the A section. One can check the [grade disparity](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/) to see the actual GPA differences. The B section lacks the emphasis on formal mathematical proof writing that the A section has. The A section and B section have different amounts of midterms and different grading policies. Read both pages to better understand the differences in content and structure.
