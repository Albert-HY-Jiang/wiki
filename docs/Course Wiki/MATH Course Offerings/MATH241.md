# MATH241

MATH241 (Calculus III) is a 4-credit-hour class that is a important requisite for later courses, and is required for the Math and Sciences requirement for both EE and CE students. It is offered in the Fall, Spring, and Summer.

## Content Covered

- Euclidean space
- Partial Differentiation
- Multiple Integrals
- Line Integrals
- Surface Integrals
- Integral Theorems of Vector Calculus

Calculus III continues where Calculus II left off, introducing the cross and dot product of vectors within the euclidean (x,y,z) space, cylindrical (r,θ,z) space, and the spherical (r, θ, Φ) space for midterm 1. This is followed by the gradient (∇) function, as well as partial differentiation and multiple integrals for midterm 2. In the later portion of the course, the Jacobian matrix, change of variables, and Lagrange multipliers are covered for midterm 3. For midterm 4 and beyond, line integrals, surface integrals, as well as Green's, Stoke's, and the divergence theorems are taught.

## Prerequisites

Students are required to have completed MATH231 (Calculus II) or received at least a 4 on AP Calculus BC.
