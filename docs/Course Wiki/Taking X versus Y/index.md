# Overview

Ever found two courses that appear to be the exact same but probably aren't? Fear not! This section of the course wiki is dedicated to advising students about the difference between two courses (and which is the right for them). The following list contains all pairs that currently have an active wiki page. It's terribly short, so please consider contributing by going to our [GitHub](https://github.com/hkn-alpha/wiki) and opening a pull request by following the readme.
