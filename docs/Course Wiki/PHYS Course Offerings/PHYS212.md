# PHYS212

PHYS212 (ELectricity and Magnetism) is a 4-credit hour course that is required for both EEs and CEs as a part of the Foundational Mathematics and Science requirement. It is offered in the fall, spring and summer semesters.

## Content Covered

- Coulomb's Law
- electric fields
- Gauss' Law
- electric potential
- capacitance
- circuits
- magnetic forces and fields
- Ampere's law
- induction
- electromagnetic waves
- polarization
- geometrical optics.
  
PHYS212 begins with an introduction to the basics of electricity such as Coulomb's Law, electric fields and Gauss's Law. Then the course introduces DC circuit and circuits elements, such as resistors and capacitors. After the that, the course moves on to magnetism with topics such as Biot-Savart Law, Ampere's Law and Faraday's Law. AC circuits are then introduced with inductors. The course then relates electicity and magnetism by introducing electromagnetic waves. At the end of the semester, Polarization and Optics are introduced.

## Prerequisites

- [MATH241](MATH241.md) (corequisite)

The official prerequisite to PHYS212 are credit in [PHYS211](PHYS211.md)(although they are not directly related) and credit or concurrent registration in [MATH241](MATH241.md). (Understanding of various concepts from Calculus will be helpful in PHYS214 although the calculations used in PHYS214 are relatively simple) 

## When to Take It

ECE majors typically take PHYS212 within the first two semesters. PHYS212 is a prerequisite to [ECE210](ECE210.md)

## Course Structure

PHYS212 holds two lectures each week. There are prelectures and checkpoints before each lecture. Attendance for the lectures is required using iClickers. In addition to the lectures, PHYS212 also has a required discussion section, which meets weekly. During the discussion, students work on a problem set related to the topics covered in the lectures. At the end of the discussion, there is a weekly quiz except during the midterm weeks. There is also a required weekly lab section. During the lab, students work on a lab related to the topics covered in the lectures. There are prelabs due before the labs and a lab report due at the end of the lab session.

Homework is assigned every week on smartPhysics.  

There are three one-hour long midterm exams at CBTF. An electronic formula sheet is given. Final exam is written on paper. Practice exams are given both as pdfs on the course website and as practice exams in Prairielearn. 

## Instructors

Recently, this course has been taught by Professor Paul Kwiat and Professor Benjamin Hooberman

## Course Tips

The provided practice exams are very similar to the real ones. It's the best tool to study. The provided formula sheet is useful but it's important to know which equations apply to which problems. 

## Life After

Students will generally take [PHYS213](PHYS213.md) and [PHYS214](PHYS214.md) the semester after taking PHYS212. They are not directly related to PHYS212 but are both requried for EEs and CEs. After PHYS212, students can take [ECE210](ECE210.md) which is also reqruired for EEs and CEs.
