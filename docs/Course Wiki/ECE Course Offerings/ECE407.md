# ECE407

ECE407 (Cryptography) is a 3 credit hour course that (doesn't count for anything? Advising office needs to fix this.) It is offered in the fall semester only.

- RSA Cryptosystem
- Random Oracle Model
### MPC and ZKP
- Zero Knowledge Proofs
- Multi Party Computation
- Garbled Circuits
- Secret Shares
  
ECE407 is meant to be an undergraduate introduction to modern cryptography. It first covers symmetric key cryptography, which answers the question "How do two parties communicate securely?". This includes topics like one-time pads, perfect secrecy, and PRFs and PRGs. Next it covers public-key crytography, which expands on symmetric-key cryptography but allows for multiple parties to communicate with one. This covers topics like the RSA cryptosystem and key exchange protocls. There is very interesting math used to construct public-key schemes. Finally, the course covers Multi-Party Computation and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Which answer the questions "How do I prove that I know the answer to a problem without showing the answer?" and "How do two parties jointly compute a function over inputs without revealing what those inputs are to each other?". 

## Prerequisites
- [CS225](../CS%20Course%20Offerings/CS225.md)
- [ECE374](ECE374.md)

CS225 and ECE374 are the only official prequisites for this course. CS225 is important because most homeworks have a small coding portion that requires students to know how to write C++. ECE374 is required because it is important to be able to analyze the runtimes of algorithms, as well as understand reductions and NP-(hardness/completeness). [ECE313](ECE313.md) may also be helpful although not necessary, as security definitions are often written in terms of probabilities. 

## When to Take It
ECE or CS students should take ECE407 whenever they feel like it! 

## Course Structure
Outside of class, ECE 407 has a fairly light workload, consisting of only 4-6 homeworks throughout the semester. 

Besides homeworks which make up 50% of your grade, another 10% is made up by mandatory attendance. 


## Instructors
Most recently this class has been taught by David Heath, who is a great professor.

## Course Tips
ECE 407 can be a conceptually difficult course, as there are lots of different definitions introduced and it is necessary to keep track of how the all relate to each other. Go to office hours to solidify your understanding of basic topics like security defintions before you get overwhelmed with content. 

## Life After

Students who enjoyed Multi-Party Computation should look into taking the Secure Computation section of CS598.

## Infamous Topics
- Group Theory. Some basic group theory is used to construct schemes for symmetric key cryptography. This can be difficult for students without a strong math background. 
- Simulators. Simulators are used in different proofs and security definitions throughout the last third of the course. They can be very difficult to understand, especially in malicious multi-party computation.
