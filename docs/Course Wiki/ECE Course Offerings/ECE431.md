# ECE431

ECE431 (Control Systems) is a 4-credit-hour senior/graduate level course that satisfies the Technical Electives requirement for ECE majors and counts as a hardware lab course. It is offered only in the spring.

## Content Covered

- Power measurement, three-phase power (ECE330 review)
- Power factor control
- Single-phase transformer tests and theory
- Saturation and harmonic effects in three-phase transformers
- Induction motor testing and theory
- Induction motor performance
- DC machine testing, theory, and performance
- Sychronous machine testing, theory, and performance
- Digital simulation of machine dynamics
- Energy control projects

 The grid is the most complex man made machine that conisists of an ever growing quantity of electric machines that are synchronized together and work to maintain stability.

 
Note: Control Systems, in this course, refer to obtaining useful properties of systems, such as disturbance rejection and stability, using mathematics. This is different from using a microcontroller and software. The latter is not covered in this course.

The first part of ECE486 is a brief survey on what a control system is, why it is important, and the parameters that a control system designer is looking for. The next part of the course covers the Laplace Transform and how to design a control system using the Laplace domain. The course continues by talking about how to design control systems using the frequency domain (which has various benefits and drawbacks compared to the Laplace domain). Finally, the course wraps up by giving a brief survey of designing control systems using state-space method (which is the most powerful, albeit the most difficult). The course places great emphasis on design and experimentation.

This course has a required lab component. In the lab, students apply the various methods learned in lecture to design control systems, usually for a DC motor. For the final lab project, students are tasked with balanacing an inverted pendulum. This is a nontrivial task, but very fulfilling when it works.

The course only deals with linear and time-invariant (LTI) systems.

## Prerequisites
- [ECE330](ECE330.md)
- [ECE210](ECE210.md)

[ECE210](ECE210.md) is the only official prerequisite to the course. However, the course teaches students everything about systems, BIBO stability, Linearity, and the Laplace Transform, so it is not necessary to remember any of these from ECE210. A more pertinent prerequisite is [MATH257](../MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH257.md), since the state-space method relies heavily on linear algebra methods and theorems, such as finding eigenvalues.

## When to Take it

This course is one of the logical next steps in the power systems sequence after [ECE330](ECE330.md). Many students feel like this class solidifies and continues on from ECE330 material while also reinforcing knowledge through the labs. Take this course if you are at all interested in electric vehicles, power systems, and/or the electric grid. Definetly take this class if you want to go more into depth on the theory and machines first introduced to you in ECE330.

Usually Professor Haran teaches this course. 

## Course Tips

The course content can often get tedious, as each technique often carries many steps that are mathematically long. Make sure you understand why each step is the way it is and when to use each technique.

Ask questions in lecture! Controls is a confusing and nuanced topic and it is easy to get lost. Believe me, you are not the only one who gets lost every lecture. Ask questions!

Start the prelabs and lab reports early. They will get very annoying as the semester progresses.

## Life After

This is the only ECE class on controls at the undergraduate level. Related classes include [ECE310 - Digital Signal Processing I](ECE310.md) (more on linear systems) and [ECE470 - Introduction to Robotics](ECE470.md). For those interested in continuing control systems, [ECE515 - Control System Theory and Design](ECE515.md) is usually the next course to take. ECE486 also briefly touches on optimization techniques while covering state-space method. For those interested in that type of content, [ECE490 - Introduction to Optimization](ECE490.md) would be a great course to take.

## Infamous Topics

- Root locus method: The method is long and tedious. Write each step down, practice applying it on your own in homeworks, and put it on your cheatsheet for the exam. If you fully understand what each step is useful for, then the method will become intuitive and easier to remember.
