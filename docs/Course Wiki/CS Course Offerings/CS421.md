# CS421

CS421 (Programming Languages and Compilers) is a 3-credit hour course that counts as an Advanced Computing elective and is explicitly required for CS majors.
## Content Covered

This course teaches students functional programming, and the theory and implementation behind interpretes / compilers. Student's learn OCaml, and use it for all assignments and midterms. 
Throughout the course they will use OCaml to build a lexer, parser, type checker, and evaluator for a toy functional programming language called PicoML. 
### Functional Programming
- Pattern Matching and Recursion
- Continuation Passing Style
- Currying
- Higher Order Functions
- Abstract Data Types

### Compilers
- Abstract Syntax Trees
- Type Checking, Inference, and Unification
- Lexing and Lexer Generators
- Parsing and Parser Generators
- CPS Transformation

## Prerequisites
- [MATH257](./CS374.md)
- [CS374](./CS374A.md)

## When to Take it

For Computer Engineering majors, CS421 is taken to fulfill preqrequiste requirements for other CS classes mainly [CS426 - Compiler Construction](./CS426.md). If taking this class just because it is a prequisite, instead first try to get an override so you don't have to take it.
For CS Majors, this class is required, but is not a preqreqisite for any other required class, so feel free to put it off until the last semester.

## Course Structure

Course Structure is changing drastically in Spring 2024, moving to a flipped classroom style with mandatory attendance.

### Exams and Grading

CS421 has three midterms and one final, with the midterms taken in the CBTF.

## Instructors

The instructor for CS421 is usually Elsa Gunter.

## Course Tips

## Life After

CS374 (or ECE374) is a prerequisite for [CS421 (Programming Languages)](./CS421.md), a required course for Computer Science majors. Students who enjoyed the middle third of the course will enjoy [CS473 (Algorithms)](./CS473.md). Students who enjoyed the first and last thirds of the course will enjoy [CS475 (Formal Models of Computation)](./CS475.md).
